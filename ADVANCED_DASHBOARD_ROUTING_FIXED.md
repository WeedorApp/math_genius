## 🚀 **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **🔄 UPDATED AUTHENTICATION FLOW:**

#### **Registration Process:**
```dart
// After successful student registration
if (user.role == UserRole.student) {
  context.go('/student');  // → Advanced Dashboard
} else {
  context.go('/home');     // → General Home
}
```

#### **Login Process:**
```dart
// After login, home screen checks user role
final currentUser = await userManagementService.getCurrentUser();
if (currentUser?.role == UserRole.student) {
  context.go('/student');  // → Advanced Dashboard
}
```

#### **Class Selection:**
```dart
// After class selection
if (widget.userRole == UserRole.student) {
  context.go('/student');  // → Advanced Dashboard
} else {
  context.go('/home');     // → General Home
}
```

### **🏠 SMART HOME SCREEN:**

#### **Automatic Student Detection:**
```dart
return FutureBuilder(
  future: _checkUserAndRedirect(context, ref),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    // Shows loading while checking user role
    // Redirects students automatically
    // Shows home screen for non-students
  },
);
```

#### **Quick Access Actions:**
```dart
final actions = [
  _ActionItem(
    title: 'Dashboard',     // 📊 Direct access
    icon: Icons.dashboard,
    onTap: () => context.go('/student'),
  ),
  _ActionItem(
    title: 'Games',         // 🎮 Game selection
    icon: Icons.games,
    onTap: () => context.go('/game-selection'),
  ),
  // ... other actions
];
```
