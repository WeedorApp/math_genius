- âœ… Added debug logging for authentication flow

### 3. User Management Service

- âœ… Fixed LocaleNotifier usage in settings
- âœ… All authentication methods are properly implemented

### 4. Authentication Screen
- âœ… AuthScreen is fully functional with login/register
- âœ… Firebase connection test button works
- âœ… Form validation implemented
- âœ… Error handling and user feedback

## ðŸ”„ CURRENT STATUS

The authentication system is now **ACTIVATED** and ready for testing:

1. **App starts with SplashScreen** - checks authentication status
2. **Routes to AuthScreen** if no user is logged in
3. **Routes to HomeScreen** if user is authenticated
4. **Full authentication flow** with Firebase integration

## ðŸ§ª TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### To test the authentication flow:

1. **Start the app** - it should show the splash screen first
2. **Check authentication** - if no user is logged in, it will route to `/auth`
3. **Test Firebase connection** - use the "Test Firebase Connection" button
4. **Register a new account** - fill out the registration form
5. **Login with existing account** - use the login form
6. **Verify navigation** - successful auth should route to `/home`

### Expected Behavior:
- âœ… Splash screen appears for 2 seconds
- âœ… Routes to auth screen if not logged in
- âœ… Firebase connection test works
- âœ… Registration creates new user account
- âœ… Login authenticates existing users
- âœ… Successful auth navigates to home screen

## ðŸš€ READY FOR EVALUATION

The authentication system is now fully activated and ready for final product evaluation. Users can:

- Register new accounts
- Login with existing accounts
- Test Firebase connectivity
- Navigate through the app with proper authentication flow

The app is running on Chrome at http://localhost:59098 and ready for testing!
