## ðŸ”„ CURRENT STATUS

The class association system is now **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** and compliant with SSOT v1.0.0:

### Registration Flow:
1. **User selects role** â†’ Student/Parent/Teacher/Admin
2. **If Student** â†’ Class selection appears
3. **Class Selection** â†’ Shows available classes with lock status
4. **Validation** â†’ Requires class selection for students
5. **Registration** â†’ Creates user and initializes class access
6. **Class Access** â†’ Sets selected class as active, others as locked

### Class Locking Logic:
- **Pre-K**: Always unlocked (starting point)
- **Kindergarten**: Locked until Pre-K completed with 70+ score
- **Grade 1**: Locked until Kindergarten completed with 75+ score
- **Higher Grades**: Progressive unlocking based on prerequisites

## ðŸ§ª TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### To test the class association system:

1. **Start registration** â†’ Select "Student" role
2. **Class selection appears** â†’ Only Pre-K should be unlocked
3. **Select Pre-K** â†’ Should be able to proceed
4. **Try other classes** â†’ Should be locked with lock icon
5. **Complete registration** â†’ User created with class access initialized
6. **Verify in app** â†’ Student should only have access to selected class

### Expected Behavior:
- âœ… Class selection only appears for student registration
- âœ… Only first class (Pre-K) is unlocked initially
- âœ… Locked classes show lock icon and are non-selectable
- âœ… Form validation prevents registration without class selection
- âœ… Class access is properly initialized after registration

## ðŸš€ SSOT v1.0.0 COMPLIANCE VERIFIED

### Architecture Compliance:
- âœ… **Modular Design**: Class management in separate service
- âœ… **Barrel Exports**: Proper feature encapsulation
- âœ… **Role-Aware UI**: Different flows per user role
- âœ… **Progressive Access**: Locked/unlocked class system
- âœ… **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles its domain

### Educational Compliance:
- âœ… **Age-Appropriate**: Classes have min/max age ranges
- âœ… **Prerequisite System**: Higher grades require completion
- âœ… **Content Categories**: Each class has specific learning areas
- âœ… **Difficulty Progression**: Increasing complexity across grades

The class association system is now fully operational and ready for final product evaluation!
